\section{Conclusion}

In this work we worked with the main ideas from the discipline "Medical Robotics" in a Matlab ambient. We have done since tests with simple gravity and different values for viscous friction, gravity compensation, different cartesian forces, tests for position control, for compliance control and impedance control. Then we designed a trajectory simulating an operation where we have a vital organ that cannot be touched and finally a free research. All of these with different simulink schemes so that we could simulate every situation, and for that we created many different functions.

Finally, we think this project helped us to understand the theoretical part while implementing all of this project. And about the free research we think it is a good exercise, because it develops our creativity in these medical ambients after we understood the basic about medical robotics.
